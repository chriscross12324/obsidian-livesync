# Settings of Self-hosted LiveSync

There are many settings in Self-hosted LiveSync. This document describes each setting in detail (not the setup process). The configuration and settings are divided into several categories, each indicated by an icon. The icons are as follows:

## 0. Update Information

This pane shows version update information. You can check what has changed in recent versions.

## 1. Setup

This section is for setting up Self-hosted LiveSync. There are several methods to complete the setup.

### 1. Quick Setup

The easiest and fastest way to set up Self-hosted LiveSync. You can complete the setup with just a few clicks.
